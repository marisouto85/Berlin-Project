            <h1>Welcome to Berlin </h1>

            <h2><span>Did you know....?</span></h2>

            <h2>Berlin is almost 9-times bigger than Paris</h2>

            <p> With an area of 892 square kilometres, Berlin is nearly nine times the size of Paris. Despite its
                enormous
                size, Berlin does not feel overwhelmingly large, which is due to its population density. With 4,000
                inhabitants per square kilometre, the German capital offers a more open atmosphere than Paris, where the
                density is much higher at 21,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. This makes the city feel more
                spacious,
                especially compared to the busy streets of Paris.</p>

            <h2>Berlin has more waterways than Venice or Amsterdam</h2>

            <p>While Venice and Amsterdam are renowned for their canals, Berlin surpasses them with a network of 180
                kilometres of waterways. The city’s vastness contributes to this aquatic wonder. Although Amsterdam
                boasts
                more bridges with over 2000, Berlin's 1700 bridges add a distinctive architectural charm to its
                water-filled
                landscape.</p>

            <h2>Unique traffic light: The beloved Ampelmännchen</h2>

            <p>Berlin has an interesting connection with traffic lights. Europe’s first traffic light was installed in
                Potsdamer Platz in 1924. During the division of the country, each side featured its distinct traffic
                light
                figure. After reunification, there was an attempt to replace the iconic Ampelmännchen with its West
                German
                counterpart. However, this move faced strong opposition from Berliners, leading to widespread protests.
                This
                led
                to the inclusion of the cheerful traffic light figure in the city's guidelines, preserving its cult
                status
                as a
                symbol of Berlin's identity.</p>

                        Stylish houses and lots of greenery make the district attractive for residents.</p>

                    <span class=dot>...</span>

                    <p class="extra">During the 19th century, Pankow became a popular destination fro day trips as well
                        as a
                        preferred spot for the summer residences of the upper middle class. The Royal House of
                        Hohenzollern built Schönhausen Palace, Pankow's most important sight, as a summer residence.
                        Thus, Pankow developed into a suburb of villas emblematic of the economic upswing of the
                        Wilhelminian era.</p>

                            the middle of a city of millions. The Grunewald is framed by water on both sides: to the

                            the Havel, to the east by the chain of lakes. The forest is cut through by the "Avus", the
                            motorway built as a race track, and the parallel railway line. You can only pass under the
