        <p>On 26 June 1963, then US President John F. Kennedy visited West Berlin to mark the 15th anniversary of the
            Berlin Airlift. He was the first US president to visit the divided city after the construction of the Berlin
            Wall on 13 August 1961. With his speech in front of Sch√∂neberg City Hall, in which Kennedy emphasised the
            value of freedom and ended with the famous sentence "Ich bin ein Berliner", Kennedy left no doubt about his
            solidarity with Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
